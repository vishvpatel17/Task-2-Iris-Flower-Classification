# Task-2-Iris-Flower-Classification
This project implements a machine learning model to classify three different species of Iris flowers based on their physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).  Using the iconic Iris Dataset, I explored data preprocessing and implemented classification algorithms to achieve high predictive accuracy.
